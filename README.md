## **About**

Who doesn't like a good old quiz?! Quizzes are a fun way to spend your time when you are bored, you are not only entertained but also gain knowledge along the way!

Do you think you love watching movies and have watched a lot of movies in the past, that you consider yourself a movie buff? Take a few minutes complete the quiz, you will find out if that is true!

This Movie Quiz is designed to include a wide range of questions about all types of movies. From the old to the new, from cartoon to fantasy, any movie you can think of. It's made of 125 questions, each game has 10 questions, each correct question gains 10 points. So you can keep playing and aim for that 100 points each time! Have fun!

## **Users Experience (UX)**

### **Project Goals**

- The primary goal of this project is to set up a form of game or mind sport for the players that may become a brief assessment for the user to measure their knowledge in films.

- The secondary goal is to help the user get their thinking mind on. According to studies, brain games may help sharpen certain thinking skills that tend to wane with age, such as processing speed, planning skills, reaction time, decision making, and short-term memory.

### **Target Audience**

- Considering the format of the quiz for this project, as there won't be pictures displayed in the question, our target audience will be over 16 year old.

- In today's world, everything is international, and that includes the film industry. Most of the popular movies are known by the majority of people of the world. Considering that, our target audience's location is global.

- As there's no evidence to show that men love watching moives more than women or vice versa (even though I hear a lot from my female friends that their men watch the same movie over and over!), our target audience will be both genders.

- The best way to promote our quiz game is through online advertisements and social media shares.

### **Design**

- **Colour Scheme**

  The two main colours used are red and yellow, you can find a copy of the colour palette [here](assets/documentation/MS2-color-palette.pdf)

- **Typography**

  - Franklin Gothic Medium is the main font used throughout the whole website for main text and buttons, with Arial Narrow, Arial, sans-serif as the fallback font in case of any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly. Franklin Gothic is an common font and it suits the scheme and makes the website appealing.

  - The headline font is Oswal by google font with sans-serif as the fallback font. It fits in the feel of the site perfectly.

- **Imagery**

  - Imagery is very important. The background hero image is designed to grab the user's attention and give the users the feeling as if they are in a cinema.

  - The end game illustrations demonstrate to the user how they did, gives immediate feed back, not only appealing but also encouraging.
