    <title>Html&css seperartion (div)</title>
    The html <div> element is the generic  container for flow content.It has no impact on the layout or content until it is styled in some way using css
    .(for example,the style is applied directley to it ,or a layout model type,such as flexbox,is applied to its parent element)
    As a pure container , the <div> element is inherentley nothing.Instead, it is used to group content to be easily styled using the class or id attributes, 
    making a section of a document as written in a different langauge (using the attribute lang),and so on.
